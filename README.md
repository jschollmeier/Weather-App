 We were tasked with adding notes to this application and then adding new features.
 We added a location feature that determines your current location via a google maps api and then displays the weather data for your area
 another feature we added was a delete button that deleted your recent entries when you click the delete button 

 When we got the application it already ran really well and was able to display weather information for the current day as well as the next five days for a location you inputted. 






We Used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.
